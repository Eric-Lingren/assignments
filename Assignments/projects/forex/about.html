           <h2>It's like optimization, only better!</h2>
           <br>
           <p>
            95 % of daytraders loose money, however 90% of traders pick the correct direction when opening a position.  How is this possible!? <br>Well part of it is due to emotions and part of it is due to improper exits.  We help you take the guesswork out of the latter.
           </p>
           <p>
            In-platform MT4 optimization is inherrently flawed because of its lack of reliable historical data as well as the tendency of traders to curve-fit their stratagies to fit past data rather than using live data to evaluate their strategies.  MyForexAnalyzer avoids both of these problems by using the data from your already exited and entered positions to determine where you are missing opportunites in your strategy.   
           </p>
           <p>
            MyForexAnalyzer does not evaluate your entry conditions.  Instead, we pull your entry and exit timestamps from all your positions that you have already closed and evaluate if you exited the positions at the optimum timing.  It does this by identifying your exit time and then scanning reliable historical price databases online to identify if you should have held your position longer or should have exited earlier.  We have found that if many people simply adjust their S/L and T/P conditions only slightly, they are able to become more profitable and successful traders.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is not a curve-fitting optimizer.  It simply identifies <b><i>on averge</i></b> if you are holding your trades for the correct duration, exiting positions prematurely, or closing your positions late and not taking money off the table while you had the chance.  We aslo evaluate if you have any emotional weaknesses by holding onto your losing trades longer than is necessary.
           </p>
           <br>
           <p>
            TLDR: We help provide insight on the best way for you to exit your positions based on reducing drawdown or increading profits, whether this is by increasing/reducing targets or by adjusting holding timeframes.
