Eric - great job! Check out my feedback below and in the comments in the code.

* Consider putting all your `.gif`s into a folder called `img` or `assets` so they're not all scattered around the project root folder
* Use a for loop to set the visibility of all the gifs. See my comments in app.js for an example.
