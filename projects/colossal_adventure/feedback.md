You've got an _excellent_ division of responsiblities and organization in this game. Every function has its own specific purpose, and you call on those functions when needed

There's only a couple of places you could make some functionality more reusable, like creating a function to display the tombstones and some text. You also could benefit a little by sticking to conventions regarding indentation and spacing, but even those are pretty well done in this program. One tool that will make things like that easier is [Prettier](https://prettier.io/).

Really great job!
